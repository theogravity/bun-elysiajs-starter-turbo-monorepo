# Development Server

Start or stop the Central backend API server for local development and testing.

## Usage

```
/dev-server [start|stop|status]
```

## Instructions

This skill manages the Central backend API server running on port 9800.

### Commands

**start** (default):
1. Check if the server is already running by calling `curl -s http://localhost:9800/health`
2. If already running, inform the user and exit
3. If not running, start the server in the background:
   ```bash
   cd apps/backend && bun run dev
   ```
   Use `run_in_background: true` for the Bash tool
4. Wait for the server to be ready by polling the health endpoint (up to 10 seconds):
   ```bash
   for i in {1..10}; do curl -s http://localhost:9800/health && break || sleep 1; done
   ```
5. Confirm the server is running and ready

**stop**:
1. Find the server process: `lsof -ti:9800`
2. Kill the process if found: `kill $(lsof -ti:9800)`
3. Confirm the server has stopped

**status**:
1. Check if the server is running by calling the health endpoint
2. Report the status to the user

## Example Output

```
Starting Central backend server...
Server started in background (task ID: abc123)
Waiting for server to be ready...
✓ Server is running at http://localhost:9800

You can now run the test generator:
  cd packages/transport-central && bun run test-generator
```

## Notes

- The server runs on port 9800 by default
- Uses an in-memory SQLite database by default
- Logs are available in the background task output
